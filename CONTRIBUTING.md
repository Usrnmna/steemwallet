### Feature requests, pull-requests

I specifically envision keeping the app lightweight. I certainly don't intend to compete with other great apps out there such as the eSteem app or for example Steepshot.

If you want to help, and want the app in your native language, feel free to help translate!
please explore the app thoroughly and check the [app/i18n/en/strings.xml](app/i18n/en/strings.xml) translation file, make a copy and translate all the texts. Whenever the %1$s or %2$s (etc etc) is used in that file it is the place of a variable, which should be quite obvious. (E.g. strings like: *Can't find account "%1$s"* - would obviously have the account name filled in at %1$s)
